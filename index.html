                        ### Aggregate Production Function and Income distribution

                        Lectures on Political Economy - Production and Distribution- Part II 

                        > \...**when all the factors of production are increased in the same
                        > proportion, the total product also increases exactly
                        > proportionately**\...A more general proof is the following. If we regard
                        > the product $P$ as a function of the number of labourers, $a$, and of
                        > the number of units of land, $b$, both $a$ and $b$ being regarded as
                        > continuous, then the marginal productivities may be expressed by the
                        > partial derivatives of $P$ with respect to $a$ and $b$; therefore, **if
                        > the condition is to be satisfied, we must have**
                        > $$a\frac{\partial P}{\partial a}+b\frac{\partial P}{\partial b}=P$$ a
                        > partial differential equation, the general integral of which is known
                        > to be: $$P=af\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)$$ in which $f$ is an arbritrary
                        > function, i.e. $P$ must be homogenous and linear function of $a$ and
                        > $b$. Among the infinite number of functions which satisfy this
                        > condition, we may give **as an example $P=a^{\alpha}b^{\beta}$ in which
                        > the indices $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are two constant fractions whose
                        > sum$=1$.**

                        > To give an account of **the real nature of capital, its role in

                        > difficult than with the other two factors and has led to innumerable
                        > controversies among economists**\...In the ordinary sense of the term,
                        > it includes all auxiliaries to production, with the exception of
                        > natural forces in their original form, and direct human labour\....If
                        > for the moment we leave aside the question of the origin of the
                        > productivity (or value-creating power) of capital, and regard it as an
                        > empirical fact, we may readily apply to capital the theory developed
                        > above---that **the share of the product going to any particular factor
                        > of production is determined by its marginal productivity**.


                        > We may thus regard **capital** as a single coherent mass of **saved-up
                        > labour and saved-up land**, which is accumulated in the course of years...

                        > land, and, on the other hand,
                        > $F_{a_{1}}=l_{1}\left(>l\right)$,$F_{b_{1}}=r_{1}\left(>r\right)$

                        > clearly demands that $l_{1}:l=r_{1}:r$. The two equal quantities
                        > $$\frac{l_{1}-l}{l}=\frac{r_{1}-r}{r}=i$$ will then each represent the
                        > rate of interest on the investment of capital for one year.

                        > conclusion. An excess of money will, according to Ricardo, show itself
                        > in two ways---partly through a rise in all prices, partly through a

                        > If the monetary institutions offer their money or their credit on
                        > abnormally favourable terms, this must logically lead to an

                        ### Inflation and deflation

                        Introductory - Chapter I  

                        > **Changes in the general level of prices** have always excited great
                        > interest. Obscure in origin, they **exert a profound and far-reaching
                        > influence on the whole economic and social life of a country**.
                        
                        > \..**.A general rise in prices is, of course, to the disadvantage of all
                        > those who receive fixed money incomes**, as is the case to-day with a
                        > constantly increasing number of social groups. It is also to the
                        > disadvantage of all those who derive the whole, or a large part, of
                        > their incomes by lending money capital of one kind or another.
                        
                        > **A lasting fall in the prices of all commodities is generally
                        > recognised as no less significant an evil**. While it is true that with
                        > the same wages the workers would be able to obtain more of the
                        > necessaries of life, this advantage is frequently outweighed by the
                        > other consequences of a fall in prices. Business is paralysed, and
                        > growing unemployment and falling wages result.

                        > THE tremendous expansion of credit during and since the World War to finance military operations as well as post-war reparations, reconstruction, and the rebuilding of industry and trade has brought the problems of capitalism and the nature and origin of interest home afresh to the minds of business men as well as to economists...

                        #### Intertemporal Equilibrium

                        > The relation of both impatience and opportunity to the rate of interest, in my opinion, can be comprehended
                         accurately only by analyzing rigorously these concepts and determining the effect of each upon the income
                          stream. By this procedure, we arrive at a fundamental explanation of the nature of impatience and of return
                           on income invested and see how, by changes in the income stream, these rates are brought into conformity
                            with the rate of interest.

                        #### Debt Deflation



                        > I am offering this paper as embodying, in brief, my present "creed" on the whole subject of so-called "cycle theory." My "creed" consists of 49 "articles" some of which are old and some new.
                        
                        >13. There may even be a general over-production and in either of two senses: (a) there may be, in general, at a particular point of time, over-large inventories or stocks on hand, or (b) there may be, in general, during a particular period of time, an over-rapid flow of production. The classical notion that over-production can only be relative as between different products is erroneous. Aside from the abundance or scarcity of particular products, relative to each other, production as a whole is relative to human desires and aversions, and can as a whole overshoot or undershoot the equilibrium mark. In fact, except for brief moments, there must always be some degree of general over-production or general under-production and in both senses-stock and flow.
                        
                        >14. But, in practice, general over-production, as popularly imagined, has never, so far as I can discover, been a chief cause of great dis-equi- librium. The reason, or a reason, for the common notion of over-pro- duction is mistaking too little money for too much goods.
                        ....
                        
                        >24. Assuming, accordingly, that, at some point of time, a state of over-indebtedness exists, this will tend to lead to liquidation, through the alarm either of debtors or creditors or both. Then we may deduce the following chain of consequences in nine links: (1) Debt liquidation leads to distress selling and to (2) Contraction of deposit currency, as bank loans are paid off, and to a slowing down of velocity of circula- tion. This contraction of deposits and of their velocity, precipitated by distress selling, causes (3) A fall in the level of prices, in other words, a swelling of the dollar. Assuming, as above stated, that this fall of prices is not interfered with by reflation or otherwise, there must be (4) A still greater fall in the net worths of business, precipitating bank- ruptcies and (5) A like fall in profits, which in a "capitalistic," that is, a private-profit society, leads the concerns which are running at a loss to make (6) A reduction in output, in trade and in employment of labor. These losses, bankruptcies, and unemployment, lead to (7) Pes- simism and loss of confidence, which in turn lead to (8) Hoarding and slowing down still more the velocity of circulation. The above eight changes cause (9) Complicated disturbances in the rates of interest, in particular, a fall in the nominal, or money, rates and a rise in the real, or commodity, rates of interest.

                        ### Effective demand determines actual employment


                        The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money - chapter 3

                        > A brief summary of the theory of employment...
                           In this summary we shall assume that t**he money-wage** 
                          and other factor costs **are constant** per unit of labour employed.
                        


                        > The outline of our theory can be expressed as follows. When **employment
                        > increases**, **aggregate real income is increased**. The **psychology** of the
                        > community is such that when aggregate real income is increased
                        > **aggregate consumption is increased**, but **not by so much as income**.
                        > Hence employers would make a loss if the whole of the increased
                        > employment were to be devoted to satisfying the increased demand for
                        > immediate consumption. Thus, **to justify any given amount of employment
                        > there must be an amount of current investment sufficient to absorb
                        > the excess of total output over what the community chooses to consume
                        > when employment is at the given level**. It follows, therefore, that,
                        > given what we shall call the community's propensity to consume, the
                        > equilibrium level of employment, i.e. the level at which there is no
                        > inducement to employers as a whole either to expand or to contract
                        > employment, will depend on the amount of current investment. **The
                        > amount of current investment will depend**, in turn, **on** what we shall
                        > call the inducement to invest; and the inducement to invest will be
                        > found to depend **on the relation between the schedule of the marginal
                        > efficiency of capital and the complex of rates of interest on loans of
                        > various maturities and risks**. Thus, given the propensity to consume
                        > and the rate of new investment, there will be **only one level of
                        > employment** consistent with equilibrium; since any other level will
                        > lead to inequality between the aggregate supply price of output as a
                        > whole and its aggregate demand price. This level **cannot be greater
                        > than full employment**, i.e. the real wage cannot be less than the
                        > marginal disutility of labour. But there is no reason in general for
                        > expecting it to be equal to full employment. **The effective demand
                        > associated with full employment is a special case**, only realised when
                        > the propensity to consume and the inducement to invest stand in a
                        > particular relationship to one another. This particular relationship,

                        > Mr. Keynes takes as typical of "Classical economics" the later writings
                        of Professor Pigou, particularly The Theory of Unemployment. Now The
                        Theory of Unemployment is a fairly new book, and an exceedingly
                        difficult book; so that it is safe to say that it has not yet made much
                        impression on the ordinary teaching of economics.

                        > For example, Professor Pigou's theory runs, to a quite amazing extent,
                        in real terms. Not only is his theory a theory of real wages and
                        unemployment; but numbers of problems which anyone else would have
                        preferred to investigate in money terms are investigated by Professor
                        Pigou in terms of "wage-goods."

                        > Since our purpose is comparison, I shall try to set out my typical
                        classical theory in a form similar to that in which Mr. Keynes sets out
                        his own theory; ... Thus I assume that I am dealing with a short period in which the

                        fixed**.

                        #### Classics' Model by Hicks

                        Assumptions:

                        - Labour is homogenous

                        - No depreciation: output of investment goods corresponds to new investment.

                        -  $w$, the rate of money wages per head is given.

                        - Let $x,y$, be the outputs of investment goods and consumption goods
                        respectively

                        - $N_{x},N_{y}$,,be the numbers of men employed in producing them

                        - capital is fixed therefore production functions depends only on labour, $$x=f_{x}(N_{x})$$ and $$y=f_{y}\left(N_{y}\right)$$

                        - $M$ is the exogenous quantity of money.

                        We want to determine total employment $N = N_{x}+N_{y}$.

                        Production side

                        Competition implies prices, here in nominal terms, that are equal to marginal costs (since Cournot): $$P_{x}=w\frac{dN_{x}}{dx}$$
                        $$P_{y}=w\frac{dN_{y}}{dy}$$

                        Income in the investment sector is $$I_{x}=P_{x}x=w\frac{dN_{x}}{dx}x$$ and in the consumption
                        sector $$I_{y}=P_{y}y=w\frac{dN_{y}}{dy}y$$ therefore total income $I$ in perfect competion equilibrium is
                        $$I=w\frac{dN_{x}}{dx}x+w\frac{dN_{y}}{dy}y$$

                        Demand side

                        Quantity theory $\left(Mv=PY\right)$: $$M=kI$$

                        Therefore if $k$ is given the equation determines $I$.



                        Demand of investment goods

                        $$I_{x}=C\left(i\right)$$

                        Equilibrium requires that investment equals savings (that depends on interest rate and income) $$I_{x}=S\left(i,I\right)$$

                        General Equilibrium

                        Given $M$ and $k$ we have $I$,  we can then determine $i$ and
                        $I_{x}$. Now using $I_{x}=P_{x}x=f_{x}(N_{x})w\frac{dN_{x}}{dx}$ we have
                        $N_{x}$, and using
                        $$w\frac{dN_{y}}{dy}f_{y}\left(N_{y}\right)=I-f_{x}(N_{x})w\frac{dN_{x}}{dx}$$
                        we have $N_{y}$. Therefore we have total employment $N = N_{x}+N_{y}$.

                        #### Classics' Model by Hicks

                        Exercise 1:

                        If $C(i)$ shifts to the right the interest rate increases. If the amount
                        of saving rises, the amount of investment will rise too; labour will be
                        employed more in the investment trades, less in the consumption trades;
                        this will increase total employment if the elasticity of supply in the
                        investment trades is greater than that in the consumption-goods
                        trades-diminish it if vice versa.

                        Exercise 2:

                        If you increase $M$, $I$ increases,  $S$ increases for a fiven $i$ so
                        $I_{x}$ increases and the interest decreases. Employment will increase
                        in sector $x$, what happens to $y$ depends on the various elasticities.

                        Exercise 3:

                        A rise in the rate of money wages will necessarily diminish employment
                        and raise real wages.
                        $$w\frac{dN_{y}}{dy}f_{y}\left(N_{y}\right)+w\frac{dN_{x}}{dx}f_{x}(N_{x})=I$$

                        $w$ increases, with constant $I$ it has to be that $N_{x,y}$ decrease
                        which implies that the real wage increase. They move in the same direction tha nominal in this model.

                        #### Keynes' model by Hicks

                        The demand of Money depends on the interest rate (Liquidity Preference) $$M=L\left(i\right)$$

                        Investment $$I_{x}=C\left(i\right)$$

                        Equilibrium $$I_{x}=S\left(I\right)$$ where a possible influence of the rate of interest on the amount saved out of a given income is neglected.

                        > Now the rate of interest, not income, which is determined by the
                        quantity of money. The rate of interest set against the schedule of the
                        marginal efficiency of capital determines the value of investment; that
                        determines income by the multiplier.

                        <!-- .slide: style="text-align: left;" -->

                        But Keynes recognizes that the demand of Money depends on the interest rate and Income  $$M=L\left(I,i\right)$$

                        > This brings us to what, from many points of view, is the most important thing in Mr. Keynes' book.
                         It is not only possible to show that
                        a given supply of money determines a certain relation between Income and
                        interest (which we have expressed by the curve LL); it is also possible
                        to say something about the shape of the curve. It will probably tend to
                        be nearly horizontal on the left, and nearly vertical on the right. This
                        is because there is (1) some minimum below which the rate of interest is
                        unlikely to go, and (though Mr. Keynes does not stress this) there is
                        (2) a maximum to the level of income which can possibly be financed with
                        a given amount of money. If we like we can think of the curve as
                        approaching these limits asymptotically

                      
                        > If the supply of money is increased, the curve $LL$ moves to the
                        right\...but the horizontal parts of the curve are almost the same.
                        Therefore, again, it is this doldrum to the left of the diagram which
                        upsets the classical theory.... So the General Theory of Employment is the Economics of Depression.

                        <!-- .slide: style="text-align: left;" -->

                        Hicks also introduces a version of Investment that depends on Income
                        
                        $$I_{x}=C\left(i,I\right)$$

                        Equilibrium $$I_{x}=S\left(I,i\right)$$

                        <center><img class="plain" src='assetsHT/Hicks2.png'  width="500" ></center>

                        > As before, Income and interest are determined where the IS and LL curves
                        intersect-where the investment rate of interest equals the money rate.
                        Any change in the inducement to invest or the propensity to consume will
                        shift the IS curve; any change in liquidity preference or monetary
                        policy will shift the LL curve. If, as the result of such a change, the
                        investment rate is raised above the money rate, Income will tend to
                        rise; in the opposite case, Income will tend to fall; the extent to
                        which Income rises or falls depends on the elasticities of the curve.

                        > If there is "full employment" in the sense that any rise in Income
                        immediately calls forth a rise in money wage rates; then it is possible
                        that the CC and SS curves may be moved to the right to exactly the same
                        extent, so that IS is horizontal.

                        > However that may be, if IS is horizontal, we do have a perfectly
                        Wicksellian construction, the investment rate becomes Wicksell's natural
                        rate, for in this case it may be thought of as determined by real
                        causes; if there is a perfectly elastic monetary system, and the money
                        rate is fixed below the natural rate, there is cumulative inflation;
                        cumulative deflation if it is fixed above.

                        > The General Theory of Employment is a useful book; but it is neither the
                        beginning nor the end of Dynamic Economics.
